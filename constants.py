    # Steps

    2. **Scoring Experience**: Based on relevance and duration, assign a numerical score between 0 and 100. Only consider jobs directly related to the provided job title.

    3. **List of Relevant Experiences**: For each relevant experience, gather:
    - Position
    - Company
    - Duration

    4. **Description Generation**: Write a concise explanation detailing the candidate's relevant experience and justify the score given.

    # Examples

    **Example Input**

    - Any job experiences must be clearly related to the job title in order to be included and affect the score.
    - Pay attention to detail, ensuring that only relevant experiences are used for scoring and reflection.
    - The answer should be in Spanish
